/// Abstract base class for 3-D grid-based diffusion equation solver.
///
/// This class provides functions to solve the diffusion equation for different
/// types of fields. The target equation can be written as
/// \f$\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = \mu\nabla^3 f\f$ where \f$\mu\f$ is
/// the diffusion coefficient. The field \f$f\f$ can be either scalar or vector
/// field.
